## About me
I am am fourth-year PhD candidate in NLP under the supervision of prof. [Ekaterina Shutova](https://www.shutova.org/) at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) (ILLC) at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). In 2021 I was awarded a [Google PhD fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/) which supports my research and connected me to my co-supervisor at Google, dr. [Dan Garrette](http://www.dhgarrette.com/). Before my PhD I graduated with a bachelor's and master's degree in AI from the UvA and worked as a research assistant for prof. [Jelle Zuidema](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/w.zuidema/) at the ILLC.

My main research interests include multilingual NLP, modular deep learning, interpretability and social biases in LMs.

I am submitting my thesis this summer and am looking for job opportunities starting in fall 2024.
