## About me
I am a PhD candidate in NLP under the supervision of prof. [Ekaterina Shutova](https://www.shutova.org/) at the [Institute for Logic Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) (ILLC) at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). In 2021 I was awarded a [Google PhD fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/) which supports my research and connected me to my co-supervisor at Google, [Dan Garrette](http://www.dhgarrette.com/). My main research interests include multilingual NLP, modular deep learning, interpretability for LMs and social biases in LMs. Before my PhD I completed my bachelors and masters in AI at the UvA and worked as a research assistant for [Jelle Zuidema](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/w.zuidema/).

I am submitting my thesis this summer and am looking for job opportunities starting in fall 2024.
